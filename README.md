**Diwali Sales Analysis with Python**

**Overview**
This project aims to perform a simple analysis of Diwali sales using Python. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most significant festivals in India and is often associated with increased sales across various industries. By analyzing Diwali sales data, we can gain insights into consumer behavior, popular products, sales trends, and more.

**Features**
**Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the raw sales data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of sales, top-selling products, sales trends over time, etc.
**Visualizations**: Create visualizations such as bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps to effectively communicate insights derived from the data.
**Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to identify significant trends or correlations in the sales data.

**Requirements**

1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)
3. Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy


**Usage**

**Data Acquisition**: Obtain the Diwali sales data either from internal sources or public datasets.
**Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data to ensure consistency and reliability in analysis.
**EDA**: Use Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks to perform exploratory data analysis.
**Visualization**: Generate visualizations to present key findings and insights.
**Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to validate hypotheses or identify patterns.

**Documentation: Document your findings, methodologies, and conclusions in the README file and/or accompanying reports.**
